    <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
    <p>
      WASP-19 is a magnitude 12.3 star located in the Vela constellation of the southern hemisphere.
      This star has been found to host a transiting hot Jupiter-type planet in tight orbit.
      The WASP-19 is older than Sun, has fraction of heavy elements above solar abundance, 
      and is rotating rapidly, being spun up by the tides raised by the giant planet on the close orbit 
      (pulled from wikipedia)

    <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
    <p class="colored">
      Our sun will explode it is only a matter of when it will explode or go supernova for a more correct term 
      and we cannot stop it, at least not with the technology we currently have.
